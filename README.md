# CONSOLE.LOG EXERCISES: Getting Started 
[//]: # (autograding setup start)
## Setup
- clone this repository to your machine
- open a terminal in VS Code
- If necessary, cd into the project directory
- run `npm install` in the project directory
[//]: # (autograding setup end)

These exercises are aimed at making you familiar with using node to run your scripts & the console.log method. For each exercise, run your script in node to check if your console.log(s) are working. Remember to use camelCase where needed.
## Instructions
Work in the file `solution.js`  

1. Console log this line of text: "This is an exercise in console logging" (do not forget quotation marks). 

2. Declare a variable called `exercise` and give it the following value: "This is the value.". Console log the `exercise` **variable**. 

3. Declare a variable called `firstName` and assign your first name to that variable. Also create a `lastName` variable and assign your last name. Console log both variables in the order firstName, lastName. NOTE: When console logging two variables, separate the variables with a comma (,) in the console log e.g. console.log(variable1, variable2);

4. Make a profile of yourself. Store all the information in additional variables. To the existing ones `firstName` and `lastName` add `city`, `job` and `age`. Console log the variables in the order firstName, lastName, age, city, job. 

5. Print a sentence using all the profile variables above, adding text for sentence flow in the following format: "John Smith is a 43 year old teacher who lives in Berlin". Replace parts of this string with your variables. **you can combine variables with text in the console by using the plus symbol (+) e.g. console.log("this is a " + variable);**

## Code style
This exercise will automatically check if your code complies with the [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript). You will not be able to commit if it doesn't.

## Points
You will receive points for correctly completed tasks in the repository on GitHub. Check there after pushing to see how many points you achieved.
### Debugging your code
> [reading the test outputs](https://github.com/DCI-EdTech/autograding-setup/wiki/Reading-test-outputs)

There are two ways to see where you missed points for tasks:
#### 1. Running tests locally
Run `npm test` in the terminal. You will see where your solution differs from the expected result.

#### 2. Inspecting the test output on GitHub
- Go to the [Actions tab of your exercise repo](https://github.com/FbW-D01/jest-test-2021-hibaDCI/actions)
- You will see a list of the test runs. Click on the topmost one.
- Click on 'Autograding'
- Expand the item 'Run education/autograding@v1'
- Here you see all outputs from the test run
